          <br />
          <p style="color: white; font-weight: 100">
            Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest
            class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula
            racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de
            l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been
            one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its
            inaugural running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to
            the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A
            Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands
            Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents
            around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public
            roads.

          <br />
          <p style="color: white; font-weight: 100">
            A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World
            Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors
            (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the
            highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA,[2] and the races
            must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by
            the FIA for tracks.

          <br />
          <p style="color: white; font-weight: 100">
            Qualifying determines the grid for the race. Qualifying is split
            into three parts: Q1, Q2, and Q3. Each session lasts for a specific
            amount of time and eliminates a number of cars with Q1 lasting 18
            minutes (eliminating five drivers) Q2 lasting 15 minutes (another
            five), and Q3 lasting 12 minutes to determine the order of the top
            10 on the grid. At six races in 2023, qualifying occurs on a Friday
            afternoon and sets the grid for a Sprint race on Saturday. Held over
            a third of a Grand Prix distance, the result of the Sprint sets the
            grid for Sunday.

          <br />
          <p style="color: white; font-weight: 100">
            The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on
            the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often
            referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with
            no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost
            ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of
            the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to
            increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to
            clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race
            start.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="color: white; font-weight: 100">
            Once all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car
            positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track
            indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at
            intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished
            simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3
            seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be
            abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an
            unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens,
            the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the
            offending car removed from the grid.
